## MySQL Replicator
Replicates data changes from MySQL binlog to HBase or Kafka. In case of HBase, preserves the previous data versions. HBase storage is intended for auditing and analysis of historical data. In addition, special daily-changes tables can be maintained in HBase, which are convenient for fast and cheap imports from HBase to Hive. Replication to Kafka is intended for easy real-time access to a stream of data changes.

### Documentation
This readme file provides some basic documentation on how to get started. For more details, refer to official documentation at [mysql-time-machine](https://mysql-time-machine.github.io/).

### Building required Docker images
1. Run `mvn package` from the root of the `replicator` repository to build the MySQL Replicator jar that will be used later;
2. Rename built jar to `mysql-replicator.jar` and copy it to the `images/002_replicator_runner/input/replicator/` directory inside the `docker` repository;
3. Run `container_build.sh` script from the `images/002_replicator_runner/` directory inside the `docker` repository;
4. Run `docker ps` to verify that `replicator-runner` image has been built successfully;

### Getting Started with MySQL Replicator
Replicator assumes that there is a pre-installed environment in which it can run. This environment consists of:

 - MySQL Instance
 - Zookeeper Instance
 - Graphite Instance
 - Target Store Instance (Kafka, HBase, or none in case of STDOUT)
 
Easiest way to test drive the replicator is to use docker to locally create this needed environment. In addition to docker you will need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed locally.

````
git clone https://github.com/mysql-time-machine/docker.git
cd docker/docker-compose/replicator_kafka
````

Start all containers (mysql, kafka, graphite, replicator, zookeeper)
 
```
  ./run_all
```

Now, in another terminal, you can connect to the replicator container
 
```` 
 ./attach_to_replicator
 cd /replicator
````
 
 This folder contains the replicator jar, the replicator configuration file, log configuration and some utility scripts. 
 Now we can insert some random data in mysql:
 
 ````
 ./random_mysql_ops
 ...
 ('TwIPn','4216871','313785','NIrnXGEpqJI gGDstvhs'),
 ('AwqgI','4831311','930233','IHwkTOuEnOqGdEWNzJtq'),
 ('WIJCB','1516599','487420','rPnOHfZlIvEEvFFEIGiW'),
 ...
 ````

 This data has been inserted in pre-created database 'test' in precreated table 'sometable'. The provided mysql instance is configured to use RBR and binlogs are active.
 
````
  mysql --host=mysql --user=root --pass=mysqlPass
  
  mysql> use test;
  mysql> show tables;
  +----------------+
  | Tables_in_test |
  +----------------+
  | sometable      |
  +----------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
````
 
 Now we can replicate the binlog content to Kafka. 
 
````
 ./run_kafka
````
 
 And read the data from Kafka
 
 ````
 ./read_kafka
````

In this example we have writen rows to mysql, then replicated the binlogs to kafka and then red from Kafka sequentially. However, these processes can be run in parallel as the real life setup would work.

As the replication is running, you can observe the replication statisticts at graphite dashboard: http://localhost/dashboard/
